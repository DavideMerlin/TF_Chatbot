# TF_Chatbot
Implemented TensorFlow Sequence to Sequence model to train a ChatBot on a [Movie Dialogue Dataset](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) provide by Cornell. The model should take a few hours to fully trian. I look forward to improve this model to adapt TF learn. It will then generate styled-specific sentences. It is interesting to play with the hyperparameters as well.
